# AbsorptionTMM
We intend to use the transfer matrix representation to calculate the local absorbed energy density as a function of space. 
The description of the formulas and the way we are implementing them can be found here: [Description](https://github.com/udcm-su/AbsorbtionTMM/blob/master/Description/LocalAbsorbitonTMM.pdf)
